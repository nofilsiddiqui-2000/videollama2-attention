In the video, a large flock of pigeons is gathered in a city square. They are pecking at the ground, possibly searching for food. The pigeons are scattered throughout the area, with some near a statue and others near a nearby building. As the camera pans around, we can see the pigeons flying up and taking off, revealing their massive numbers. The sound of the pigeons pecking and flapping their wings can be heard in the background. It seems like a typical day in the city, with the pigeons gathering in the square for food.
